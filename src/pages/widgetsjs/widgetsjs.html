<p class="introduction">
    Widgetsjs started as a PoC for a <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://dev.to/neutrino2211/do-we-need-to-compile-website-components-5a22" target="_blank">post</a> on dev.to
    and it slowly grew from there. After a while I cleaned up the code and rewrote it in typescript, this helped it's progress. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Widgetsjs helps developers use front-end logic like "update this when this happens" as a UI element which can be treated
    as a standalone element and is reusable across the project.
</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>
    When I started this project, the goal was to create a light-weight model view controller that is scalable and provides most functions
    that are provided by other libraries and ultimately to have a good learning experience on how libraries like Vue work under the hood.

</p>

<h2>Toolchain</h2>

<p>
    The project is written in pure typescript. This was done to reduce the chances of having type errors or "undefined is not a function"
    problems, that has been my approach to most of projects.

    <br>
    <br>

    Typescript also proved to be a good choice when it came to creating interfaces that are shared between classes like how a
    "StatelessWidget" and a "StatefulWidget" both under the hood are "Widget"s that inherit from "HTMLElement"
</p>

<h2>Problems Encountered</h2>

<p>
    One of the problems I encountered was having a widget change it's content based on it's state, this was a problem I never
    encountered before but after some research I found out about the "MutationObserver" which allowed me to detect
    changes in the elements attribute and Object getters and setters that helped me detect when an object in memory changed.
</p>

<h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>

<p>
    Through out the development process, I learnt more about how the DOM handles events and updates itself accordingly.
    I also learnt how most model view controllers work and this knowledge has helped me many times at work where
    I'd know how to help out colleagues when they got stuck on special Vue.js use-cases

    <br>
    <br>

    It has also helped me appreciate all the great work done by the developers of countless libraries and how much easier they
    have made life for us.
