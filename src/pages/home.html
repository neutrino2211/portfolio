<p>I'm a 19-year-old Student at the Federal University of Technology, Minna currently studying Cyber Security Science.</p>

<p>Through my years as a student and Intern, I've met Developers and Designers that have made me grow as a developer and understand what is expected of me in
    a professional workspace. These experiences have shaped me into a developer that is capable of creating software applications from idea to product with code
    that is easy to understand and follows security guidelines and policies.</p>

<h2 id="skills">My Skills</h2>

<p>Since I came into this field, I've gained a good understanding of problem solving and how to approach challenges posed by different stacks and environments
    and have dedicated a lot of time to learn more about computing on the web in general. The knowledge gained from this and my IT security studies 
    helps me apply these concepts to real world applications.</p>
