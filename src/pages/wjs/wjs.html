<p class="introduction">
    Webjs is a project that was born when I was finding my way in a world dominated by web apps and cordova.
    At the time, I was still learning how to turn my web apps into native apps but it was challenging to try and
    link my vue-based websites to cordova and manage both the dependencies of vue and cordova seperately.
    <br>
    <br>
    Webjs(wjs) allows users to create multiple project types (e.g React, Vue and Angular) and not only have one tool
    to compile these projects to web apps and also native apps but also manage both the web dependencies and native
    dependencies.
</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>
    The goal was and still is to create a tool that simplifies the process of creating and maintaining web apps which I myself
    could also use.

    <span class="green" style="font-weight: bold;">This website itself is built and maintained with wjs</span>
</p>

<h2>Toolchain</h2>

<p>
    The project was initially written with javascript but as it grew larger I realized it would be very hard to track bugs so it
    was moved to typescript. <span class="green" style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Typescript</span> was chosen mainly because of it's compile time type checking that prevents undefined from showing up
    in places where it's not needed.

    <br>
    <br>

    Aside from being mostly bug proof, Typescript also helped with implementing common functions as classes or
    interfaces that can be reused.
</p>

<h2>Problems Encountered</h2>

<p>
    The biggest problem I faced was trying to make sure that the supported project types are compiled according to 
    their specific standards. This was most evident with addig angular support where most of the features provided
    by the angular cli could not be replicated without a change in compiler.

    <br>
    <br>

    Till today that remians a problem with angular support not having important features like
    component generators or the other utilities angular cli provides as extra.
</p>

<h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>

<p>
    This project helped appreciate what it takes to create tools that help developers with their daily work, 
    it also helped me solidify my knowledge in typescript.

    <br>
    <br>

    It is a project that I keep working on in my spare time to try and make it better with user feedback and
    using the most effective combination of features to support a large field. It has at times been frustrating
    to work on but I enjoy going back to it once in a while.
